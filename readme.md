An Odin implementation of the Philox psuedorandom number generator, as described [here](https://www.thesalmons.org/john/random123/papers/random123sc11.pdf).

Made with the help of these C implementations:
* [Random123](https://github.com/DEShawResearch/random123/blob/main/include/Random123/philox.h)
* [Monte Carlo Kernel Library](https://mckl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doxygen/philox_8h_source.html)
